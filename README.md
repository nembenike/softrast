# 3D Software Rasterizer

## What is this?
If you couldn't guess by the name, it rasterized 3D objects into 2D stuff on the screen.

## How?
A bunch of maths, most of which I don't even understand (yet).
Matrices, Vectors, and the combination of both, also weird projection stuff.

## Usage
There's no clear usage on how to do anything in this, however you can run the demo by just building the project.


## How to build?
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nembenike/softrast && cd softrast
cc -o nob nob.c # you only need to this once, nob rebuilts itself upon changes
./nob
```

## Assets
We pack the assets into an assets.pak alongside the engine executable in the build/ directory generated by nob.
This is loaded at runtime, and we can extract assets from it, so no need to load everything seperately.

## Nob
This is the unique build system our project uses, it was created by Mr. Tsoding, and is available [here](https://github.com/tsoding/nob.h).

## What works?
- Packing assets into a .pak file
- Parsing .obj files
- Rendering .obj files
- Camera movement
- Some basic UI for FPS drawing and loading screens
